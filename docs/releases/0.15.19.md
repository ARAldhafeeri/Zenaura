# Zenaura Version 0.15.0 Release Notes

This release focuses on making Zenaura more beginner-friendly with targeted improvements, simplifying development and enhancing usability.

---

## **Key Improvements**

### **AsyncDispatcher**

- **Simplified Event Management**: Developers can now dispatch asynchronous events without needing deep knowledge of `asyncio` or coroutines.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Introduced `dispatcher.bind` for hooking component callbacks to events (e.g., document, window, or element by ID):
  ```python
  dispatcher.bind("counter", "click", counter.increment)
  ```
  This enables cleaner, more intuitive event management.

### **Simplified App Routing**

- Added a facade for app initialization. Developers now only need:
  ```python
  app = App()
  app.run()
  ```
  No need to manually import or configure `asyncio`.

### **Improved Mutator Handling**

- Introduced `@mutator` for asynchronous callbacks (e.g., API fetching) and `@mutates` for regular Python callbacks:

  ```python
  @mutator
  async def coroutine():
      pass

  @mutates
  def callback():
      pass
  ```

### **Streamlined Initialization**

- Reduced the number of required files and dependencies for Zenaura initialization.
- Enhanced HTML tag support for cleaner, modern code.
- Now you can include only **init**.py in config.json, and import all needed zenaura logic in there to be used within the browser.

}

## **Updated Example Code**

Here's how these improvements simplify app setup:

```python
from zenaura.client.app import Route, App
from zenaura.client.page import Page
from zenaura.client.component import Component
from zenaura.ui import div, h1, h2, img

class ZenauraStarter(Component):
    def render(self):
        return div(
            div(
                img(src="./public/logo.png", width=255, height=255, alt="starterLogo"),
                h1("The Python Framework For"),
                h2("Building Modern Web User Interface"),
            ),
            class_="zenaura"
        )

starter = ZenauraStarter()

# App and routing
app = App()
home_page = Page([starter])

app.add_route(Route(
    title="Developer-Focused | Zenaura",
    path="/",
    page=home_page
))

app.run()
```
